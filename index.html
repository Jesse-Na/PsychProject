    <p> This website was created by Jason and Jesse as an inquiry on Sensation and Perception.
        There are a collection of games for you to enjoy, all of which are grounded in psychological theory.
        Click on any of the tabs to visit the games that we created. </p>

    <p> These games were created to demonstrate the effect of switch tasking on concentration,
        focus, and productivity. </p>

    <p> Our inquiry was concerned with designers, and how they can create better, simplistic and easier to understand user interfaces using knowledge of switch-tasking and the way in which humans process information </p>
